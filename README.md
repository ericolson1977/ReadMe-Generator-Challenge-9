# ReadMe-Generator-Challenge-9

## Description
With the goal of being able to quickly create a README.md file, I created a simple command line application. On open the terminal, the user will be prompted to answer a series of questions about the project. Once the user completes the questions, a README.md file will be created and the user input data will be render in that file. There will be a Table of Contents that will include clickable section title that will take you directly the corresponding section. Email addresses and GitHub usernames will be live clickable links which will open a new email message or take you to the appropriate GitHub page. 

## Table of Contents
